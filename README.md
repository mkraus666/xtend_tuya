# Xtend Tuya - extended version 

Same as the original Xtend tuya - but with additional devices and entities. 

The development includes a generic part to get ALL entities of a device and show them. 

PRO: We got all sensors and are able to use them
CON: Its your job to label them correctly in HA due the fact we dont know what they are for ;) Additionally the possibility to control them is also not possible (yet).

Work in progress... stay tuned.
